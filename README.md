This repository houses the code for the academic paper **"A utility function to improve antibiotic decision-making: a simulation study"**, for the purpose of peer review and subsequent open-sourcing.

If you use this code please cite this repository.

***Instructions for use:***

The electronic healthcare record source data can be obtained from PhysioNet at https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/ once the terms of access are met. The csv filenames used in this code match the following default filenames that can be downloaded from the *hosp* folder at the bottom of the page: *"prescriptions.csv", "d_icd_diagnoses.csv", "diagnoses_icd.csv", "d_icd_procedures.csv", "procedures_icd.csv", "labevents.csv", "d_labitems.csv", "microbiologyevents.csv", "poe_detail.csv", "poe.csv", "omr.csv", "admissions.csv", "patients.csv"*, and *"services.csv"*.

The discrete choice experiment source data is found within this repository:

1. "ADAPT-AST Factors influencing Antimicrobial Prescribing for Urinary Tract Infection.csv" for the main analysis
2. "labelled_ADAPT-AST Factors influencing Antimicrobial Prescribing for Urinary Tract Infection.csv" for the specialty sub-analyses

This code was written and run using *R* version 4.3.2 and *Python* version 3.12.0, on a laptop computer running macOS Sonoma version 14.5 with an Apple M1 Pro processor, 16GB random-access memory and 10 cores. The code may need to be run in chunks, depending on application memory. The typical run time of all code was approximately 5 days.

Before running the code, the data and *Python* files should be saved into a secure local directory - the filepath of this directory should then be substituted into the file in place of **#FILEPATH#** in all R scripts before running the code. The required package versions are included in the *packages.csv* file within this directory.
