***Instructions for use:***

The source data can be obtained from PhysioNet at https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/ once the terms of access are met. The csv filenames used in this code match the following default filenames that can be downloaded from the *hosp* folder at the bottom of the page: *"prescriptions.csv", "d_icd_diagnoses.csv", "diagnoses_icd.csv", "d_icd_procedures.csv", "procedures_icd.csv", "labevents.csv", "d_labitems.csv", "microbiologyevents.csv", "poe_detail.csv", "poe.csv", "omr.csv", "admissions.csv", "patients.csv"*, and *"services.csv"*.

This code was written and run using *R* version 4.3.2 and *Python* version 3.12.0, on a laptop computer running macOS Sonoma version 14.5 with an Apple M1 Pro processor, 16GB random-access memory and 10 cores. The code may need to be run in chunks, depending on application memory. The typical run time of all code was approximately 3-4 hours.

Before running the code, the data and *Python* files should be saved into a secure local directory - the filepath of this directory should then be substituted into the file in place of **#FILEPATH#** in all R scripts before running the code. The required package versions are included in the *packages.csv* file within this directory. A conda environment was used to run the *Reticulate* interface package - the local environment used should be substituted for **#CONDAENV_FILEPATH#** in the **PDAST_microsimulation.R**, **PDAST_microsim_I_sensitivity.R**, **PDAST_time_sensitivity.R**, and **app.R** scripts.

***Reproducing the study***

1. To reproduce the study, all scripts above must be stored in the working directory. The following scripts must then be run:  
   a. **UF_packages&setup.R**  
   b. **UF_cleaning.R**  
   c. **UF_prediction&preprocessing.R**  
   d. **UF_utility_calculations.R**  
   e. **UF_recommendations.R**  
   f. **UF_microsimulation.R**
