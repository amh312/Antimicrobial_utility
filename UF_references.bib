  abstract = {Background: Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Early recognition and treatment are the cornerstones of management. Methods: Review of the English-language literature. Results: For both sepsis and septic shock ``antimicrobials [should be] be initiated as soon as possible and within one hour'' (Surviving Sepsis Campaign). The risk of progression from severe sepsis to septic shock increases 8\% for each hour before antibiotics are started. Selection of antimicrobial agents is based on a combination of patient factors, predicted infecting organism(s), and local microbial resistance patterns. The initial drugs should have activity against typical gram-positive and gram-negative causative micro-organisms. Anaerobic coverage should be provided for intra-abdominal infections or others where anaerobes are significant pathogens. Empiric antifungal or antiviral therapy may be warranted. For patients with healthcare-associated infections, resistant micro-organisms will further complicate the choice of empiric antimicrobials. Recommendations are given for specific infections. Conclusion: Early administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs is one of the most important, if not the most important, treatment for patients with sepsis or septic shock. Drugs should be initiated as soon as possible, and the choice of should take into account patient factors, common local pathogens, hospital antibiograms and resistance patterns, and the suspected source of infection. Antimicrobial agent therapy should be de-escalated as soon as possible.},

  abstract = {Appropriate use of and access to antimicrobials are key priorities of global strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The WHO recently classified key antibiotics into three categories (AWaRe) to improve access (Access), monitor important antibiotics (Watch) and preserve effectiveness of `last resort' antibiotics (Reserve). This classification was assessed for antibiotic stewardship and quality improvement in English hospitals.Using an expert elicitation exercise, antibiotics used in England but not included in the WHO AWaRe index were added to an appropriate category following a workshop consensus exercise with national experts. The methodology was tested using national antibiotic prescribing data and presented by primary and secondary care.In 2016, 46/108 antibiotics included within the WHO AWaRe index were routinely used in England and an additional 25 antibiotics also commonly used in England were not included in the WHO AWaRe index. WHO AWaRe-excluded and -included antibiotics were reviewed and reclassified according to the England-adapted AWaRE index with the justification by experts for each addition or alteration. Applying the England-adapted AWaRe index, Access antibiotics accounted for the majority (60.9\%) of prescribing, followed by Watch (37.9\%) and Reserve (0.8\%); 0.4\% of antibiotics remained unclassified. There was unexplained 2-fold variation in prescribing between hospitals within each AWaRe category, highlighting the potential for quality improvement.We have adapted the WHO AWaRe index to create a specific index for England. The AWaRe index provides high-level understanding of antibiotic prescribing. Subsequent to this process the England AWaRe index is now embedded into national antibiotic stewardship policy and incentivized quality improvement schemes.},

  abstract = {Background There is growing evidence supporting the efficacy of shorter courses of antibiotic therapy for common infections. However, the risks of prolonged antibiotic duration are underappreciated. Objectives To estimate the incremental daily risk of antibiotic-associated harms. Methods We searched three major databases to retrieve systematic reviews from 2000 to 30 July 2020 in any language. Eligibility Systematic reviews were required to evaluate shorter versus longer antibiotic therapy with fixed durations between 3 and 14~days. Randomized controlled trials included for meta-analysis were identified from the systematic reviews. Participants Adult and paediatric patients from any setting. Interventions Primary outcomes were the proportion of patients experiencing adverse drug events, superinfections and antimicrobial resistance. Risk of bias assessment Each randomized controlled trial was evaluated for quality by extracting the assessment reported by each systematic review. Data synthesis The daily odds ratio (OR) of antibiotic harm was estimated and pooled using random effects meta-analysis. Results Thirty-five systematic reviews encompassing 71 eligible randomized controlled trials were included. Studies most commonly evaluated duration of therapy for respiratory tract (n~=~36, 51\%) and urinary tract (n~=~29, 41\%) infections. Overall, 23~174 patients were evaluated for antibiotic-associated harms. Adverse events (n~=~20~345), superinfections (n~=~5776) and antimicrobial resistance (n~=~2330) were identified in 19.9\% (n~=~4039), 4.8\% (n~=~280) and 10.6\% (n~=~246) of patients, respectively. Each day of antibiotic therapy was associated with 4\% increased odds of experiencing an adverse event (OR 1.04, 95\% CI 1.02--1.07). Daily odds of severe adverse effects also increased (OR 1.09, 95\% CI 1.00--1.19). The daily incremental odds of superinfection and antimicrobial resistance were OR 0.98 (0.92--1.06) and OR 1.03 (0.98--1.07), respectively. Conclusion Each additional day of antibiotic therapy is associated with measurable antibiotic harm, particularly adverse events. These data may provide additional context for clinicians when weighing benefits versus risks of prolonged antibiotic therapy.},

This paper aims to construct a four-dimensional example such that the BFGS method need not converge. The example is perfect in the following sense: (a) All the stepsizes are exactly equal to one; the unit stepsize can also be accepted by various line searches including the Wolfe line search and the Arjimo line search; (b) The objective function is strongly convex along each search direction although it is not in itself. The unit stepsize is the unique minimizer of each line search function. Hence the example also applies to the global line search and the line search that always picks the first local minimizer; (c) The objective function is polynomial and hence is infinitely continuously differentiable. If relaxing the convexity requirement of the line search function; namely, (b) we are able to construct a relatively simple polynomial example.},

The resource has 3 interdependent components. PhysioBank is a large and growing archive of well-characterized digital recordings of physiological signals and related data for use by the biomedical research community. It currently includes databases of multiparameter cardiopulmonary, neural, and other biomedical signals from healthy subjects and from patients with a variety of conditions with major public health implications, including life-threatening arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, neurological disorders, and aging. PhysioToolkit is a library of open-source software for physiological signal processing and analysis, the detection of physiologically significant events using both classic techniques and novel methods based on statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, the interactive display and characterization of signals, the creation of new databases, the simulation of physiological and other signals, the quantitative evaluation and comparison of analysis methods, and the analysis of nonstationary processes. PhysioNet is an on-line forum for the dissemination and exchange of recorded biomedical signals and open-source software for analyzing them. It provides facilities for the cooperative analysis of data and the evaluation of proposed new algorithms. In addition to providing free electronic access to PhysioBank data and PhysioToolkit software via the World Wide Web (http://www.physionet.org), PhysioNet offers services and training via on-line tutorials to assist users with varying levels of expertise.},

Diagnostic microbiology laboratories use one-size-fits-all testing approaches that are often imprecise, inefficient, and inequitable. Here, we report a personalised approach that adapts laboratory testing for urinary tract infection to maximise the number of appropriate treatment options for each patient. We develop and assess susceptibility prediction models for 12 antibiotics on real-world healthcare data using an individual-level simulation study. When combined with decision thresholds that prioritise selection of World Health Organisation Access category antibiotics (those least likely to induce antimicrobial resistance), the personalised approach delivers more susceptible results (results that encourage prescription of that antibiotic) per specimen for Access category antibiotics than a standard testing approach, without compromising provision of susceptible results overall. Here, we show that personalised antimicrobial susceptibility testing could help tackle antimicrobial resistance by safely providing more Access category antibiotic treatment options to clinicians managing urinary tract infection.},

  abstract = {Aims The diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is relatively complex and involves a wide variety of drugs. The purpose of this study was to use algorithms to quickly screen DILI patients, determine its incidence and identify risk factors. Methods The Adverse Drug Events Active Surveillance and Assessment System-2 was used to extract the data of patients hospitalized in 2019 according to the set standards and the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method was used to evaluate patients who met the standards. A retrospective case-control study was conducted according to suspected drugs, length of hospital stay and height- and weight-matched controls, and logistic regression was used to identify risk factors. Results Among the 156 570 hospitalized patients, 480 patients (499 cases) with DILI were confirmed and the incidence of DILI was 0.32\%. Anti-infective agents, antineoplastic agents and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the major categories of drugs causing DILI, and the highest incidence of DILI was due to voriconazole. The latency period and hospital stay of patients with cholestasis were both relatively long. Patients with hyperlipidaemia (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.884), cardiovascular disease (AOR 1.465), pre-existing liver disease (AOR 1.827) and surgical history (AOR 1.312) were at higher risk for DILI. Conclusions The incidence of DILI in hospitalized patients was uncommon (0.32\%) and its pathogenic drugs were widely distributed. The incidence of DILI for many drugs has been seriously underestimated. It is recommended to focus on patients with hyperlipidaemia, cardiovascular disease, pre-existing liver disease and surgical history.},

  abstract = {Antibiotics are the greatest risk factor for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Risk for CDI varies across antibiotic types and classes. Optimal prescribing and stewardship recommendations require comparisons of risk across antibiotics. However, many prior studies rely on aggregated antibiotic categories or are underpowered to detect significant differences across antibiotic types. Using a large database of real-world data, we evaluate community-associated CDI risk across individual antibiotic types.We conducted a matched case--control study using a large database of insurance claims capturing longitudinal health care encounters and medications. Case patients with community-associated CDI were matched to 5 control patients by age, sex, and enrollment period. Antibiotics prescribed within 30 days before the CDI diagnosis along with other risk factors, including comorbidities, health care exposures, and gastric acid suppression were considered. Conditional logistic regression and a Bayesian analysis were used to compare risk across individual antibiotics. A sensitivity analysis of antibiotic exposure windows between 30 and 180 days was conducted.We identified 159 404 cases and 797 020 controls. Antibiotics with the greatest risk for CDI included clindamycin and later-generation cephalosporins, and those with the lowest risk included minocycline and doxycycline. We were able to differentiate and order individual antibiotics in terms of their relative level of associated risk for CDI. Risk estimates varied considerably with different exposure windows considered.We found wide variation in CDI risk within and between classes of antibiotics. These findings ordering the level of associated risk across antibiotics can help inform tradeoffs in antibiotic prescribing decisions and stewardship efforts.},

Among these patients, 209 (58\%) developed aminoglycoside-associated nephrotoxicity (the acute kidney injury [AKI] group, which consisted of individuals with a decrease in cGFR of {$>$}20\% from the baseline cGFR), while 151 did not (non-AKI group). Both groups had similar baseline cGFRs. The AKI group developed a lower cGFR nadir (45 {\textpm} 27 versus 79 {\textpm} 39 ml/min/1.73 m2 for the non-AKI group; P {$<$} 0.001); was older (56 {\textpm} 18 years versus 52 {\textpm} 19 years for the non-AKI group; P = 0.033); had a higher prevalence of diabetes (19.6\% versus 9.3\% for the non-AKI group; P = 0.007); was more frequently treated with other nephrotoxic drugs (51\% versus 38\% for the non-AKI group; P = 0.024); used iodinated contrast more frequently (18\% versus 8\% for the non-AKI group; P = 0.0054); and showed a higher prevalence of hypotension (63\% versus 44\% for the non-AKI group; P = 0.0003), shock (56\% versus 31\% for the non-AKI group; P {$<$} 0.0001), and jaundice (19\% versus 8\% for the non-AKI group; P = 0.0036). The mortality rate was 44.5\% for the AKI group and 29.1\% for the non-AKI group (P = 0.0031). A logistic regression model identified as significant (P {$<$} 0.05) the following independent factors that affected aminoglycoside-associated nephrotoxicity: a baseline cGFR of {$<$}60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (odds ratio [OR], 0.42), diabetes (OR, 2.13), treatment with other nephrotoxins (OR, 1.61) or iodinated contrast (OR, 2.13), and hypotension (OR, 1.83). In conclusion, AKI was frequent among ICU patients receiving an aminoglycoside, and it was associated with a high rate of mortality. The presence of diabetes or hypotension and the use of other nephrotoxic drugs and iodinated contrast were independent risk factors for the development of aminoglycoside-associated nephrotoxicity.},

Eligible participants were aged 18 years or more and were admitted between 2017 and 2021 with suspected community-onset sepsis, defined by a blood culture draw, lactate measurement, and intravenous antibiotic administration on admission.Empiric anti--methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and/or antipseudomonal {$\beta$}-lactam agent use.Annual rates of empiric anti-MRSA and/or antipseudomonal {$\beta$}-lactam agent use and the proportion that were likely unnecessary in retrospect based on the absence of {$\beta$}-lactam resistant gram-positive or ceftriaxone-resistant gram-negative pathogens from clinical cultures obtained through hospital day 4. Annual trends were calculated using mixed-effects logistic regression models, adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics.Among 6\,272\,538 hospitalizations (median [IQR] age, 66 [53-78] years; 443\,465 male [49.6\%]; 106\,095 Black [11.9\%], 65\,763 Hispanic [7.4\%], 653\,907 White [73.1\%]), 894\,724 (14.3\%) had suspected community-onset sepsis, of whom 582\,585 (65.1\%) received either empiric anti-MRSA (379\,987 [42.5\%]) or antipseudomonal {$\beta$}-lactam therapy (513\,811 [57.4\%]); 311\,213 (34.8\%) received both. Patients with suspected community-onset sepsis accounted for 1\,573\,673 of 3\,141\,300 (50.1\%) of total inpatient anti-MRSA antibiotic days and 2\,569\,518 of 5\,211\,745 (49.3\%) of total antipseudomonal {$\beta$}-lactam days. Between 2017 and 2021, the proportion of patients with suspected sepsis administered anti-MRSA or antipseudomonal therapy increased from 63.0\% (82\,731 of 131\,275 patients) to 66.7\% (101\,003 of 151\,435 patients) (adjusted OR [aOR] per year, 1.03; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.04). However, resistant organisms were isolated in only 65\,434 cases (7.3\%) (30\,617 gram-positive [3.4\%], 38\,844 gram-negative [4.3\%]) and the proportion of patients who had any resistant organism decreased from 9.6\% to 7.3\% (aOR per year, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.87-0.88). Most patients with suspected sepsis treated with empiric anti-MRSA and/or antipseudomonal therapy had no resistant organisms (527\,356 of 582\,585 patients [90.5\%]); this proportion increased from 88.0\% in 2017 to 91.6\% in 2021 (aOR per year, 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.11-1.13).In this cross-sectional study of adults admitted to 241 US hospitals, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use for suspected community-onset sepsis accounted for half of all anti-MRSA or antipseudomonal therapy; the use of these types of antibiotics increased between 2017 and 2021 despite resistant organisms being isolated in less than 10\% of patients treated with broad-spectrum agents.},

Observational epidemiological studies measuring associations between antibiotic classes and HA-CDI were eligible for inclusion. Pooled ORs and 95\% CIs were calculated using a random effects model. Study factors identified a priori were examined as sources of heterogeneity. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.Of 569 citations identified, 13 case--control and 1 cohort study (15{$\mkern1mu$}938 patients) were included. The strongest associations were found for third-generation cephalosporins (OR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}3.20, 95\% CI{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.80--5.71; n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}6 studies; I2{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}79.2\%), clindamycin (2.86, 2.04--4.02; n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}6; I2{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}28.5\%), second-generation cephalosporins (2.23, 1.47--3.37; n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}6; I2{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}48.4\%), fourth-generation cephalosporins (2.14, 1.30--3.52; n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2; I2{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.0\%), carbapenems (1.84, 1.26--2.68; n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}6; I2{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.0\%), trimethoprim/sulphonamides (1.78, 1.04--3.05; n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}5; I2{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}70\%), fluoroquinolones (1.66, 1.17--2.35; n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}10; I2{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}64\%) and penicillin combinations (1.45, 1.05--2.02; n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}6; I2{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}54\%). The study population and the timing of measurement of antibiotic exposure were the most common sources of heterogeneity. Study quality scored high for seven studies, moderate for six studies and low for one study.The risk of HA-CDI remains greatest for cephalosporins and clindamycin, and their importance as inciting agents should not be minimized. The importance of fluoroquinolones should not be overemphasized, particularly if fluoroquinolone-resistant epidemic strains of C. difficile are absent.},

This opposition has been a traditional anchor of critiques concerned with the rise of AI decision making over human judgement. Contrary to these approaches, it is argued that human judgement is not and cannot be replaced by calculation, but that it is human judgement that contextualises computational structures and gives them meaning and purpose. The article focuses on the epistemic structure of algorithms and artificial neural networks to find that they always depend on human judgement to be related to real life objects or purposes. By introducing the philosophical concept of judgement, it becomes clear that the property of judgement to provide meaning and purposiveness is based on the temporality of human life and the ambiguity of language, which quantitative processes lack. A juxtaposition shows that calculations and clustering can be used and referred to in more or less prejudiced and reflecting as well as opaque and transparent ways, but thereby always depend on human judgement. The paper clearly asserts that the transparency of AI is necessary for their autonomous use. This transparency requires the explicitness of the judgements that constitute these computational structures, thereby creating an awareness of the conditionality of such epistemic entities.},

  abstract = {Estimates of the incidence of overall antibiotic-associated adverse drug events (ADEs) in hospitalized patients are generally unavailable.To describe the incidence of antibiotic-associated ADEs for adult inpatients receiving systemic antibiotic therapy.Retrospective cohort of adult inpatients admitted to general medicine wards at an academic medical center.  At least 24 hours of any parenteral or oral antibiotic therapy.Medical records of 1488 patients were examined for 30 days after antibiotic initiation for the development of the following antibiotic-associated ADEs: gastrointestinal, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, hematologic, hepatobiliary, renal, cardiac, and neurologic; and 90 days for the development of Clostridium difficile infection or incident multidrug-resistant organism infection, based on adjudication by 2 infectious diseases trained clinicians.In 1488 patients, the median age was 59 years (interquartile range, 49-69 years), and 758 (51\%) participants were female. A total of 298 (20\%) patients experienced at least 1 antibiotic-associated ADE. Furthermore, 56 (20\%) non--clinically indicated antibiotic regimens were associated with an ADE, including 7 cases of C difficile infection. Every additional 10 days of antibiotic therapy conferred a 3\% increased risk of an ADE. The most common ADEs were gastrointestinal, renal, and hematologic abnormalities, accounting for 78 (42\%), 45 (24\%), and 28 (15\%) 30-day ADEs, respectively. Notable differences were identified between the incidence of ADEs associated with specific antibiotics.Although antibiotics may play a critical role when used appropriately, our findings underscore the importance of judicious antibiotic prescribing to reduce the harm that can result from antibiotic-associated ADEs.},

  abstract = {This study sought to compare the efficacy and adverse effects of any aminoglycoside as a single antibiotic with other antibiotics for the treatment of patients with infection.Systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis. We searched for randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of single aminoglycoside antibiotic treatment with one or more non-aminoglycoside antibiotic for patients with infection in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, databases of ongoing trials and conference proceedings. Two reviewers assessed trial eligibility, quality and extracted data. Pooled relative risks (RR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous data.The search yielded 37 trials of which 26 included patients with urinary tract infection. Aminoglycosides were equally effective as comparators in the analysis of the primary outcomes, all-cause mortality (RR 1.11, 95\% CI 0.68, 1.81, 9 trials, 503 patients) and treatment failure (RR 1.10, 95\% CI 0.96, 1.27, 32 trials, 1890 patients). Aminoglycosides were associated with a significantly higher rate of bacteriological failure at end of therapy (RR 1.44, 95\% CI 1.21, 1.72, 27 trials, 1668 patients). Subgroup analyses according to quality of trial, type of antibiotics, source of infection and rate of clinical sepsis did not alter the outcomes. Less adverse effects in total but more nephrotoxic effects were observed in patients treated with aminoglycosides.The present data support the use of aminoglycosides for urinary tract infections. The paucity of trials including patients with sepsis or reporting on mortality precludes firm recommendations for patients with infections other than of the urinary tract.},

  abstract = {Utility functions provide a natural and advantageous framework for achieving self-optimization in distributed autonomic computing systems. We present a distributed architecture, implemented in a realistic prototype data center, that demonstrates how utility functions can enable a collection of autonomic elements to continually optimize the use of computational resources in a dynamic, heterogeneous environment. Broadly, the architecture is a two-level structure of independent autonomic elements that supports flexibility, modularity, and self-management. Individual autonomic elements manage application resource usage to optimize local service-level utility functions, and a global arbiter allocates resources among application environments based on resource-level utility functions obtained from the managers of the applications. We present empirical data that demonstrate the effectiveness of our utility function scheme in handling realistic, fluctuating Web-based transactional workloads running on a Linux cluster.},
